## Notes

### `DOCKER-USER` chain

In Docker 17.06 and higher through [docker/libnetwork#1675](https://github.com/docker/libnetwork/pull/1675), you can add rules to a new table called `DOCKER-USER`, and these rules will be loaded before any rules Docker creates automatically. This is useful to make `iptables` rules created by Fail2Ban persistent.

If you have an older version of Docker, you may just change `F2B_IPTABLES_CHAIN` to `FORWARD`. This way, all Fail2Ban rules come before any Docker rules but these rules will now apply to ALL forwarded traffic.

More info : https://docs.docker.com/network/iptables/

### `DOCKER-USER` and `INPUT` chains

If your Fail2Ban container is attached to `DOCKER-USER` chain instead of `INPUT`, the rules will be applied **only to containers**. This means that any packets coming into the `INPUT` chain will bypass these rules that now reside under the `FORWARD` chain.

This implies that [sshd](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/blob/0.10/config/jail.conf) jail for example will not work as intended. You can create another Fail2Ban container.

### Use fail2ban-client

[Fail2ban commands](http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Commands) can be used through the container. Here is an example if you want to ban an IP manually :

```bash
docker exec -t <CONTAINER> fail2ban-client set <JAIL> banip <IP>
```

### Custom actions, filters and jails

Custom actions, filters and jails can be added in `/etc/fail2ban/action.d`, `/etc/fail2ban/filter.d` and `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d`.

> :warning: Container has to be restarted to propagate changes
